### Background and Motivation:

Machine Learning has been a major contributor to the technical advancements of weather forecasting. The primary reason is the preciseness of the results and the easy availability of huge data. Machine learning and trend analysis algorithms do not need to learn the physical aspects of weather dependencies, they can predict based on the historical data alone, which makes them effective in prediction results and efficient in terms of computational resources. Recently, major work in weather forecasting has involved the use of deep learning neural networks.

Agriculture industry is the economic backbone of many countries including India. Forecasting of weather especially the temperature and rainfall prediction has proven to be very essential in agricultural planning for crop cultivation.In this project, the aim is to explore the data visualization, statistical data analysis, data cleansing, feature engineering, feature selection, and building models using R. Woking on a real-world dataset would benefit us in understanding the real-world data analysis problems. This project intends to provide a comparative model and data analysis report which could be helpful in agricultural planning. It is a perfect opportunity to have another arrow in our quiver that is, data science.

### Project objectives:

1. Building a Linear Regression model for maximum temperature prediction
2. Building a Decision tree model for maximum temperature prediction
3. Trend Analysis of target attribute by Mann-Kendall Method
4. Trend Analysis of target attribute by Sen's Slope Method
5. Comparing Machine Learning models in terms of performance
6. Comparing the Mann-Kendall Method and Sen's Slope Method in terms of performance

### Name of the dataset:

**Tapi basin_weather data_1992-2014**

It is a weather dataset of 7 weather stations in Gujarat, India obtained from the Indian meteorological department, Pune. It contains two readings at 08:30 and 17:30, every day from the year 1999 to 2014. The dataset has 76706 records and contains 15 attributes.
