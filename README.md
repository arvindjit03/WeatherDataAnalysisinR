# WeatherDataAnalysisinR
This project intends to provide a comparative model and data analysis report which could be helpful in weather dependent resource planning. We have used two predictive algorithms namely Linear regression and Regression Tree. For trend analysis we have implemented a two fold analysis approach based on Months and Station locations using two non-parametric methods namely, Mann-Kendall method and Sen's Slope Method.

Data set used: <br/>
Step 1) The main dataset used for our analysis Weather_dataset.xlsx. <br/>
Step 2) We have used FinalModifiedData.xslx file for our project <br/>
Step 3) For Station-based, predictions as well as for trend analysis we have used different files that all are present in our git repository which are all added to folder Station code <br/>
